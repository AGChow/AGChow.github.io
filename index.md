I'm a self taught game developer based in **Chicago IL**. Like many, I grew up and fell in love with video games in my youth, but, as I grow older, the artistry and engineering required to craft these experiences continues to hold my attention. My goal is to eventually work on AR/VR applications and experiences.

Frog's Revenge - made in 24 hours for a Unity game jam. The theme was "Modernize a Classic". I chose to modernize frogger by adding gameplay elements that give the player more agency and spent a lot of time adding "juice" that i felt was missing in the original 2d version. I modeled, rigged and animated the frog in blender. However, I also modeled and animated the flies in unity.

Trick or Treat - made in 1 week
